## Hello there 👋🏾. I'm Michael (he/him)

I am a trainee software developer with [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders). From a maths background, I have always loved problem solving and understanding why things work as they do 🧠. These passions together led me to...  software development.

I'm currently learning `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` ! I love the process of finding out something new everyday 🤩! If you would like to follow my findings, check out my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/michWills99)

My hobbies include playing and watching football ⚽, gaming 🎮⚔ and learning different types of languages 👩‍💻
